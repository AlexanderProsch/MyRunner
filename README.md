# MyRunner
This was a project in my first semester of Epitech and was therefore coded in C.<br/>
I coded this project in a span of two weeks.<br/>
For a succesfull compilation, the csfml library is required.<br/>
Use the Makefile to compile all the code with GCC, the binary name will be "my_runner".<br/>
Information on how to launch and play the game can be found by executing "./my_runner -h"<br/>
The Key controlls are: W and S for moving and SPACEBAR for selecting.<br/>
